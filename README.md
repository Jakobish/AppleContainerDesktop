# Apple Container Desktop: A GUI For Apple Container

A GUI for [Apple container](https://github.com/apple/container), 
a tool that we can use to create and run Linux containers as lightweight virtual machines on Mac.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The newest version is for container [0.5.0](https://github.com/apple/container/releases/tag/0.5.0) which contains some breaking changes. Please make sure to download the newest binary release for apple container in the [release page](https://github.com/apple/container/releases/tag/0.5.0).


## Perquisite
This app will not automatically download `container` so please make sure to install it either from the [GitHub](https://github.com/apple/container) or by running `brew install --cask container`.

## Installation
You can either download the entire repository and run/build it with Xcode or you can download the latest signed `dmg` for the app from the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/0Itsuki0/AppleContainerDesktop/releases).


## Basic Usage
After downloading both the `container` executable as well as this app, simply launch the app. 

By doing so, this app will try to find the `container` executable in the default location, ie: `/usr/local/bin/container`, and start the system. 
If the executable is not found, you will see the following prompting for setting a custom path and retry.

After system started correctly, we can then interact with the images and containers.
